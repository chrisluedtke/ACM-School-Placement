    <h3>Step 2 of 3: ACM Survey Data</h3>

    <p>Before uploading your survey data, ensure your survey results are clean:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check that no ACM took the survey twice, and if two ACMs have the same name, change them to make each name unique (i.e. John Smith1, John Smith2).</li>
      <li>If you did not use the SurveyGizmo survey provided by HQ, you must ensure the column names and values match the expected values in <a href='https://github.com/chrisluedtke/ACM-School-Placement/blob/master/webapp/Survey%20Items%20to%20Variable%20Names.xlsx?raw=true'>this spreadsheet</a>.</li>
      <li>To ensure certain ACMs get placed at specific schools, add a column called "Manual.Placement" to your survey results, and type the name of the school as it appears in the School Data spreadsheet from Step 1.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Upload your survey data file (.csv) and continue.</p>
