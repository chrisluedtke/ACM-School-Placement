    <h3>Step 2 of 3: ACM Survey Data</h3>

    <p>Before uploading your survey data, ensure your survey results are clean:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Check that no ACM took the survey twice.</li>
      <li>If two ACMs have the same full name, make each name unique (i.e. John Smith1, John Smith2).</li>
      <li>Ensure your column names match the expected values in <a href='https://github.com/chrisluedtke/ACM-School-Placement/blob/master/webapp/Survey%20Items%20to%20Variable%20Names.xlsx?raw=true'>this spreadsheet</a>. If used the SurveyGizmo survey provided by HQ, your column names will be converted automatically.</li>
      <li>Determine whether any ACMs should be specifically placed at a certain school (e.g. ACMs with accessibility needs, specific language abilities, or those who attended a school themselves as a student). Add a column named "Manual.Placement" to your survey results and type in any school as it appears in your School Data spreadsheet from Step 1. This guarantees that the ACM is placed at the given school.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Upload your survey data file (.csv) and continue.</p>
